amalfi.10.desc;After careful consultation with scholars, merchants, theologians, lawyers, bureaucrats, and other experts, both local Amalfians and others from abroad, we have laid down the foundations for the Tabula Amalfitana, or the Amalfian Laws. These maritime laws will provide a consistent, reasonable, and legal way of handling nautical disputes and issues. It seems that word of our achievement has already spread far and wide, and there are talks in other ports that they might adopt these Laws as the basis for their own.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.10.a;This is a proud day for Amalfi.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.11.title;Tabula Amalfitana;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.11.desc;Under the leadership of [From.GetTitledName], Republic of Amalfi has recently enacted the so-called Tabula Amalfitana, or the Amalfian Laws. Though they are not necessarily the first maritime laws ever established, they are comprehensive, consistent, and far-reaching in a way no other code has been. Already, port cities around the Mediterranean are beginning to show interest in using these as a foundation for their own maritime laws. Such fame and prestige surely reflects well on Amalfi, undoubtedly.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.11.a;This should help our own business enterprises greatly.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.11.b;Interesting news!;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.12.desc;Though the Tabula Amalfitana, or the Amalfian Laws, have served us well for many years, we have decided to reform the laws - add and remove things where needed, clarify aspects that may have been confusing or contradictory, and so on.  It is an immense effort, given the complexities of maritime law, but this endeavor has certainly been worth it. Hopefully, the Amalfian Laws will continue to provide a standard for the rest of the world for years to come!;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.13.desc;At the urging of [From.GetTitledName], the people of Amalfi have decided to reform the so-called Tabula Amalfitana, or the Amalfian Laws. The importance of this maritime code cannot be undersated, as many port cities have for years used it as a basis for their own maritime laws, or even adopted it wholesale. Now, these recent efforts to modernize the laws, and make them better suited for contemporary conditions, can only be applauded. It is certain that with these reforms, the Amalfian Laws will continue to provide a standard for the rest of the world to follow.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.21.desc;In ancient times, the settlement of Sorrento, then known as Surrentum, was home to the only pagan temple to the Sirens. With the recent resurgence of paganism along the Amalfian coast, and after some careful consideration, we have decided to dedicate a large amount of resources to rebuild this temple. There are those who fear the Sirens - who can, after all, forget Homer's haunting account of them in the Odyssey? But there is much to learn and understand from these mythical creatures, and so they are worthy of our worship.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.30.title;Bambagina Paper Invented;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.30.desc;The merchants of Amalfi have, it appears, stumbled on a discovery of a lifetime. Paper has been slowly disseminating to the west from the east over the past few generations, and it only was a matter of time before the ingenious craftsmen and artisans of Amalfi develop a new kind of parchment, which they call Carta Bambagina, or Bambagina Paper. Though it is not as durable as standard parchment, it is beautiful, as well as cheaper and easier to produce. Although some elites do not approve of it as a result, it surely will attract good business to the city of Amalfi.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.30.a;So it is!;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.31.desc;Bambagina paper is one of Amalfi's major exports, and has often been used in official documents in our realm. That said, there are those who dislike how it is not as reliable and prone to wear and tear, at least compared to other kinds of parchment. We now have an opportunity to change our stance on whether to continue encouraging its production, or banning it from official use.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.31.a;Encourage its production and use in official capacities.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.40.desc;Piracy has been an increasing concern among the settlements of the Amalfi Coast. The current system of watchtowers and fortresses, while by no means horrible, needs improvements if it is to adequately warn those living among the Amalfi Coast of any incoming pirates or invaders in time. Because the Amalfi region is of high importance due to its economic, cultural, strategic value, it is therefore imperative we find a good location to situate a large watchtower that can meet our needs. Let us send experts to survey the coastline and prepare construction materials!;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.40.a;A splendid idea. Let's do this.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.40.b;I don't have the funds for such a thing.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.41.title;A Promising Site;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.41.desc;After spending quite some time surveying the Amalfi Coast, we've found a perfect place for a new watchtower, one which will be able to see incoming pirate fleets from far away, yet is relatively close by, and will be hard for the pirates to attack and reach.\n\nA few miles off the coast by the town of Positano are the Sirenusas, an archipelago of several islands called so because the ancient Greeks and Romans believed they were inhabited by the Sirens of myth and legend. Gallo Lungo, the largest island, is shaped in a crescent moon and has housed a small monastery for years. Our surveyors also found the ruins of a small Roman tower, which we can use as a solid foundation for our own watchtower.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.41.a;Good! Start construction immediately.;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.42.desc;The watchtower at Gallo Lungo has been completed, and a garrison of a few soldiers have been sent to maintain it. It will be crucial in ensuring the safety and defense of the Amalfi Coast. One final matter remains: who shall we formally appoint as warden of this fortification? Because of its strategic location, ownership of the tower should not give this to just anyone or any family. Even if it is an honorary position, we should consider carefully who will administer this tower.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.43.desc;[From.Holder.GetTitledName], the current ruler of Amalfi, has completed a new watchtower on the island of Gallo Lungo. Built on the ruins of an old Roman watchtower, though it is not a remarkable fortification in and of itself, it is located on a strategic site, and meant to play a role in defending the Amalfi Coast from pirates and invaders who seek to plunder the riches of the region, as its inhabitants now have more time to prepare themselves from any onslaught.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.50.desc;A number of Benedictine monks have proposed that we set up a monastery on Mount Athos, the famous mountain in Greece that has become a center of the Eastern Church's spirituality and monasticism. By establishing a Latin monastery there, dialogue and cooperation between the two groups can be encouraged. Amalfi has historically had a mix of followers from both the Western and Eastern Churches, so we are ideally suited to this noble endeavor.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.51.desc;Amalfi has always enjoyed close relations with the Eastern Roman Empire, in contrast to some of the other Republics and petty feudal realms of the Italian Peninsula. A number of Benedictine monks, working together with [From.GetTitledName], have established a Latin monastery on Mount Athos, the great monastic haven of Greece. In doing so, they hope to improve relations between the Western and Eastern Churches. Due to the prominence of Amalfians in founding and developing the monastery, many have started calling this monastery the Amalfion.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.70.a;Glad to hear it!;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amalfi.71.desc;We have recently discovered the ruins of an old Roman villa on some land belonging to us along the Amalfi Coast. Even in antiquity, this region was a well-known resort destination.

amalfi.73.desc;I am inspecting some of the lemon groves in Amalfi owned by my family today.

As I travel through Scala, I hear the simple yet moving songs sung by the coral workers and fishermen of Scala as they work.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

amalfi.78.desc;The Blue Grotto of Capri is one of the most famed landmarks of the Amalfi Coast, which gets its name from how the cave walls illuminate the water to glow with a bright, mesmerizing blue color. For generations, locals have avoided this massive cave said to house monsters, witches, and demons. Even ignoring that, it is a perilous place to explore, and many have drowned in it.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x

However, they managed to scavenge some ancient Greek and Roman statues, jewels, and other valuables from the bottom of the underwater cave floor. They offer to sell some of it to you.;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;x
