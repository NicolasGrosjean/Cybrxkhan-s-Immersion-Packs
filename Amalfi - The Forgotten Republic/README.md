# AMALFI: THE FORGOTTEN REPUBLIC

Before the great merchant republics of Venice and Genoa, there was Amalfi. In Crusader Kings 2, it is a republic sandwiched between the receding Byzantine Empire to the south and the ambitious Lombard and Italian principalities to the north. This Immersion Pack will hopefully add some flavor if you're planning to rule Amalfi, whether as a Republic or not. I’ve even fixed the history files so you can play Amalfi from the 1066-1076 start dates - however, in these later years, it won’t be as easy a start, as the Republic is in decline, a shadow of its former glory, and it has a difficult starting position.

In this Immersion Pack, travel to the Amalfi Coast, which was considered a perfect resort location, even in Roman times. Take control of the fledgling republic, and defend it against oppressors, be they Byzantines, Saracen pirates, Lombard and Norman warlords, and even your fellow Italian Republics. Figure out ways to increase Amalfi’s strength and prosperity through a whole slew of new decisions and events. Will you rise above your rivals, and see to it that Amalfi remains a vibrant and powerful independent center of trade, emerging as the greatest of the merchant republics?

Please note that unlike my other Immersion Packs, I have edited a few vanilla files in order to make Amalfi playable from 1066-1076. Thus, there might be incompatibilities with any mod that edits the following files (they might be able to run together, but one mod will override the other):

- history\titles\b_konstantios.txt
- history\titles\b_mauro.txt
- history\titles\b_musco.txt
- history\titles\b_polkarios.txt
- history\titles\b_urso.txt
- history\titles\d_amalfi.txt
