#HARRANIANS: THE LAST PAGANS

Many do not know, but it is possible that the last Hellenic pagans were not the impoverished mountain peasants of the Peloponnese, but the cosmopolitan denizens of the city of Harran. For centuries, the pagans of Harran - erroneously confused with the Sabians in the Quran - have continued to worship a curious mix of Mesopotamian and Hellenic deities, and they even housed the remnants of the Neoplatonic Academy. Several Harranians famously served at the court of the Abbasids, and the temple in Harran may have been used as late as the 1000s (though this may be exaggeration).

In this Immersion Pack, you'll have the opportunity to interact with these pagans of Harran. In your hands is the fate of the Neoplatonic Academy, where wise men keep ancient learning alive, and the Temple of the Moon God Sin, where devotees have been praying for millennia. See to it that these pagans, a dwindling vestige of Hellenism, thrive, or as is inevitable, fade into the pages of history.

As a side note, I know it’s a huge stretch to make Edessa pagan, but it’s honestly more sensible than making Monemvasia pagan, since Harran was a huge major city rather than a bunch of isolated villages in the middle of nowhere. There’s a lot of controversy and uncertainty in the scholarly community about the Harranian pagans (and a lot of bunk and wishful thinking in more mainstream, New Agey type places online). For more scholarly information on the Harranians, please see Tamara Green’s The City of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of Harran.

##FEATURES

- Province of Edessa is now Hellenic Pagan at the Charlemagne and Old Gods start, via a startup event (to prevent conflicts in the history files)
- "Temple of the Moon" modifier added to Edessa also through the startup event. It provides a bonus to revolt risk and tax rate in the province.
- "Neoplatonic Academy" modifier added to Edessa also through the startup event. It provides a bonus to tech and prestige in the province.
- "Patronize Neoplatonic Academy" minor decision, which provides a minor boost to learning and prestige (and piety if pagan) for several years at the cost of gold. Available to any direct owner or any lieges of Edessa or provinces next to Edessa. Hellenic pagans get an even bigger boost out of this. Non-Hellenics will get a piety and revolt risk penalty. AI non-pagans will not patronize the academy unless they have either the Sympathy for Pagans, Scholar, Physician traits, or is a member of the Hermetics.
- "Make Offerings to the Temple of the Moon" minor decision, which provides a boost to prestige or piety (your choice) at the cost of gold. The actual amount of prestige and piety is random, and Hellenic Pagans get a bigger bonus. Available to direct ower or any lieges of Edessa or provinces next to it, if they are Pagan; can be done every three years.
- "Destroy the Temple of the Moon" minor decision, which removes the "Temple of the Moon" modifier and gives a huge one-time boost to piety and gold. Available to the direct owner of Edessa if:
	- The year is at least 900
	- Edessa is no longer Pagan
	- Owner is not Pagan or secretly Pagan
	- Owner does not have Kind, Content, or Sympathy for Pagans traits
- Added "Decline of the Neoplatonic Academy" event, which removes the "Neoplatonic Academy" modifier. Patronizing the Academy as a non-pagan will only slightly delay its inevitable decline. It has a MTTH of 120 months if the following conditions are met:
	- Edessa is no longer pagan
	- Direct ruler and/or top liege is not pagan
	- The year is 900
	- Hellenic Paganism is not reformed
- Added several Harranian characters (Levantine Arabic culture, Hellenic pagan religion) to the Charlemagne and Old Gods starts, particularly Thabit ibn Qurra and al-Battani and their direct ancestors.
- Added event to spawn Harranian courtiers (Levantine Arabic culture, Hellenic pagan religion) in the courts of nearby non-Pagan rulers, particularly Muslims, if the Temple of the Moon or the Neoplatonic Academy are still standing. 
	- If the Neoplatonic Academy is no more, the quality of the courtiers will likely be lower.
	- If the Neoplatonic Academy is being patronized, the quality of the courtiers will likely be higher.
- Added 7 flavor events related to the Harranians
