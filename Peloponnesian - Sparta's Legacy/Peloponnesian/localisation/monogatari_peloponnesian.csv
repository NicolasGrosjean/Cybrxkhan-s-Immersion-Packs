#monogatari.153.desc;The Spartans are a people of legend. The great rival to Athens and the home of famous warriors like Leonidas, the Kingdom of Sparta was once powerful and mighty.

monogatari.155.desc;The waterworks of Corinth were famous in ancient times as a site of pagan pilgrimage, but they have fallen into ruin over the centuries. The fountain of Peirene, in particular, was the most important of these waterworks. It was supposedly the favored watering hole of the divine stallion Pegasus, and was sacred to the muses - poets would often visit the fountain to drink its blessed waters in the hope they would receive inspiration. After some initial hurdles, I have set aside some funds for the restoration of the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
