#monogatari.153.title;Rebirth of Sparta;;;;;;;;;;;x
#monogatari.153.desc;The Spartans are a people of legend. The great rival to Athens and the home of famous warriors like Leonidas, the Kingdom of Sparta was once powerful and mighty. But hubris became its undoing, and it was successfully conquered - first by its former Greek vassals and enemies, then by the Romans.\n\nWith the restoration of ancient Hellenic and Roman values across the Mediterranean, [From.GetTitledName] has re-established the Kingdom of Sparta, and wishes to continue its ancient legacy. Whether the Spartan warriors shall be feared once more has yet to be seen, however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#monogatari.153.a;Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.154.desc;Many inhabitants of the rugged regions of the Peloponnese are the descendants of the ancient Dorians, including the famed Spartans. Even to this day, they are renowned for their ferocity in battle, and prove useful to those who can win their loyalty. Today, we have an opportunity to recruit a renowned fighter from one of these tribes to fight for us.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.155.title;Peirene;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.155.desc;The waterworks of Corinth were famous in ancient times as a site of pagan pilgrimage, but they have fallen into ruin over the centuries. The fountain of Peirene, in particular, was the most important of these waterworks. It was supposedly the favored watering hole of the divine stallion Pegasus, and was sacred to the muses - poets would often visit the fountain to drink its blessed waters in the hope they would receive inspiration. After some initial hurdles, I have set aside some funds for the restoration of the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.155.a;Its holy waters flow, once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.156.desc;We are ready to levy some of the local Slavic tribesmen. Should we focus on levying the Melingoi or the Ezeritai? If we have the resources, we might want to levy both.

monogatari.160.desc;Every year, the Hellenes of Laconia hold the Hyacinthia festival. Dating back to antiquity, this festival was one of the Spartans' most important celebrations, lasting several days. This time, I've decided to officially attend the one of the celebrations myself, and made some financial contributions to the festival this year.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.160.a;And now we wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.161.desc;The first day of the Hyacinthia festival is here. I and my entourage have arrived at the festival grounds, ready to witness the entire week's worth of activities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.161.a;Let's begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.title;The First Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.desc;The first day is a day of mourning for Hyacinthus. The legends tell how Hyacinthus was the god Apollo's lover. One day, the two had a friendly competition of throwing the discus, but when Hyacinthus threw his discus, it flew back and hit him, wounding him mortally. Apollo tried everything to save Hyacinthus, but one cannot stop a death dictated by the Fates.\n\nFrom Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created the Hyacinth flower, and he promised that he would forever remember his lost lover in song and music.\n\nOn this first day, sacrifices are offered to the dead, particularly Hyacinthus. Many openly weep for Hyacinthus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.a;I don't cry at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.b;I cry a little, just to keep appearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.c;I cry an appropriate amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.d;I cry a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.title;Second Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.desc;The second day of Hyacinthia is upon us! It is livelier and more cheerful than the first day, and thus is more typical of an Apollonian festival. Today, devotees celebrate Hyacinthus' rebirth as the hyacinth plant. In the spirit of celebrations, even foreigners, non-believers, and slaves are allowed to participate in the activities and great banquets of this day.\n\nMany exciting games and activities are held, to test local youths and let them demonstrate their abilities and knowledge as a rite of passage. Most prominent of the activities is a procession of beautifully adorned maidens, riding in highly ornate, decorated chariots made of wicker-work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.a;Sounds like a lot of fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.title;Third Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.desc;It is now the third day of the Hyacinthia. After the joyous celebrations of the second day, the atmosphere is now solemn once more, as many important rituals are conducted.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the festival's focus as a rite of passage for young men and women, some of them are initiated into various mysteries dedicated to various deities or heroes. Most important of these mystery cults are those of Apollo's, of course, but Dionysus' is also quite prominent as well, particularly among the women.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.a;Let the day proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.title;The Hyacinthia Ends;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.desc;The Hyacinthia is over. The festival was a touching experience, a way for us to remember the hero Hyacinthus who died long ago, as well as an opportunity for the local youths to partake in many important rites of passage to ensure they will become productive members of society. Through these many celebrations and mournings, we remind ourselves of the things we value most in people such as bravery, respect, duty, and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.a;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.desc;The food during the first day of the Hyacinthia is very bland, as befits such a solemn day. Still, the bread tastes horribly plain, and the rest of the food offered is meager, and it is a far cry from the usual delicacies I eat at home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.a;How are the others managing it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.b;That's no problem for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.desc;What sort of offering did I bring with me beforehand to offer to the dead during the Hyacinthia?;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.a;Just my presence is enough respect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.b;A small offering - a token present to put on the altar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.c;A medium offering - something decent but not too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.d;A large offering - a sacrifice worthy of the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.168.desc;During the rituals of the first day of the Hyacinthia, I must remain solemn and quiet as I mourn Hyacinthus' death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.168.a;A tragic story, it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.desc;Local youths have assembled as part of the Hyacinthia, with lyres and flutes in their hands. These young boys and girls form various choruses, and sing and play music for the glory of Apollo. Some of the festival attendees even begin dancing to the music, moving around and swaying their bodies in the ancient Dorian way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.a;It is good music!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.b;I will join in on the dancing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.desc;On the second day of the Hyacinthia, people hold small sacrifices inside their homes, and many often invite others - stranger and friend alike - to come to their house to partake in these. I myself have been invited to join in on a sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.a;Very well! I'll gladly join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.b;I have other things to attend to at the festivities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.180.a;A kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.181.desc;The honey from [Root.GetName] is, like many kinds of honey from the Peloponnese, famous throughout much of Greece and Anatolia, and perhaps even beyond in places like Italy and Egypt. Even I need to have some on stock every now and then to present to guests, or for my cooks to use in my food.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.182.desc;Recently, a young man from a prominent local Maniot clan died, one you have had some contact with in the past. Yet when you came by to show your sympathies, you noticed his family and friends were not in mourning at all during the funeral. They seemed disappointed and strangely disrespectful if anything else. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.a;How insensitive of them! Do they not care for him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.b;An odd reaction, but it is of no concern to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.c;Perhaps there is a reason behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.183.desc;An elder, who must've seen your confused expression, explained: "When a man dies in such a manner we lament him as unslain, unbled, unjustified. These are the men who give a bad name to Mani and render it hateful wherever they go. Let no one salute them but fly from them as a serpent.";;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.183.a;A noble ideal! You do your Spartan ancestors proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.183.c;An odd and cruel worldview.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.184.desc;According to old Greek legends, the Erymanthian boar lived somewhere nearby. Lately, there have been sightings of a boar that is unnaturally large, the size of entire trees. No one has been hurt though, so some dismiss this as mere hysteria or wishful thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.184.a;Send in more soldiers to patrol the area just in case!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.184.b;This is silly superstition. No boar can grow that huge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.187.desc;Tsakonian men are most famous for being ruthless and capable warriors, but they also known for their skill as masons. It is customary for them to leave their homes at certain times of year, and offer their services doing repairs and white-washing houses. This year, several have appeared at my court and asked if there was any work I needed them to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.187.a;Yes, I do have some work. Hire some of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.188.desc;There are those who say Arcadia in the Peloponnese is an idyllic, pastoral paradise, untouched by the sins and terrors of contemporary times. Given I live in the vicinity of the Arcadian region, when it comes to these claims, I feel that...;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.188.a;They are absolutely correct! Arcadia is wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.188.b;Arcadia is only great because of our hard work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.188.c;Arcadia's beauty is fleeting. We must focus on what's important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.188.d;These are exaggerations. Arcadia is the same as anywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.189.desc;Relations between the Greeks and the Slavs of the Peloponnese, though tense, are generally not as contentious as elsewhere. Recently, the two groups have engaged in a lot of peaceful trade and exchange of goods. This has helped the local economy prosper somewhat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.189.a;That is good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.190.desc;The capes of the Peloponnese are infamous for their dangers - even the ancient Odyssey mentions this. Recently, a trade ship capsized in the treacherous waters of [Root.GetName], and the locals managed to recover some of the valuable goods it was carrying.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.190.a;Let the locals keep everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.190.b;I will split with the locals and take my fair share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.190.c;As liege, I deserve everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.191.desc;I visit Tenarus, located at the very tip of the Tenarian Peninsula in Laconia, while traveling in a part of my demesne. In ancient times, it was famous for a nearby cavern said to be the very entrance to the underworld itself. Even now, locals are afraid of the cave. When I pay a visit to the cavern and peer down, several villagers accompanying me nervously warn me of the dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.191.a;We aren't superstitious pagans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.191.b;It's just another cave. The God of the Dead isn't down there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.191.d;Ha ha! What a joke! I'll go explore it for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.192.desc;I am passing by Lake Stymphalia in Corinthia. According to pagan legend, the lake was once the home of the Stymphalian birds, mighty, fearsome, vicious creatures. The pagan hero Heracles had to kill them all as part of his sixth labor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.192.a;As followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] way, we don't care for fanciful tales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.192.b;A fanciful tale that has nothing to do with true worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.192.c;It's always fascinating to see the places where Heracles may have once walked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.193.desc;The ancient Spartans had a distaste for opulent displays of wealth, and with the revival of Hellenic customs and beliefs, some are trying to revive these attitudes as well. Since some of my territories include that of ancient Sparta, it would make sense for me to emulate their attitudes in my own life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.193.a;Yes! Let us live simply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.193.b;No, it's a nice ideal but not realistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.194.desc;With the resurrection of ancient Hellenic beliefs comes debate about what is authentic and true, and what is not. Some say ancient Spartan society as we know it is exaggerated, propaganda written by the Athenians to make their rivals seem like mindless beasts. Others argue the Spartans were as was written, mighty soldiers who had little time for weakness in their people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.194.a;It's all false. Surely the Spartans had culture and compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.194.b;It's all false. The conniving Athenians are cowardly liars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.194.c;It's all true. We shouldn't tolerate softness and cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.202.desc;In the Peloponnese, there lives a wealthy, widowed landowner and noblewoman named Danielis who is known for her great wisdom and abilities, and purportedly also has some spiritual powers. Despite being a powerful and influential figure, she has often avoided involving herself in larger politics - until now.\n\nWhen you visited her recently, she presented to you many gifts: gold, valuable goods, even some of her land holdings. She says that you have the makings of a great Emperor. With time, and effort, and support from the right people, she tells you in her counsel, you can easily come to rule all of the Roman Empire. All this she has foreseen, and she will do all she can to ensure you fulfill this destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.203.desc;As Danielis had foreseen, you have become Emperor of the Roman Empire. Her dedication and resources have played an important role in your journey to the throne, yet though you wish to bestow upon her many gifts, she asks for very little in return. You are very insistent, however, and at last she relents, and says you can give her some fanciful title to acknowledge her contributions. Eventually, you and your advisors settle on the title of "Basileometor," which means "King's Mother.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.205.title;Plethon;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.205.desc;For many years, the great thinker known as Plethon has traveled far and wide throughout the Hellenistic world. However, he has decided to settle down in my territory, and has offered his services as an administrator and scholar. Despite his fame and the respect many have for him, others are suspicious of his openness towards the ancient Hellenistic ideas and beliefs. Nevertheless, this is a great opportunity for me, and I have decided to accept him as a member of my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.208.title;Book of Laws;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.208.desc;The famous scholar in your court, Plethon, has recently finished writing a book he calls Nomoi, or the Book of Laws, that encapsulates all his ideas and opinions about various topics, particularly philosophy and politics, that draws strong influence from Neoplatonism, Zoroastrianism, the philosophy of Plato, and more. The book also makes suggestions on how to deal with the political and military challenges of the day.\n\nPlethon offers to give you the book to help you in administering your realm and to provide you spiritual and moral guidance. On one hand, Plethon has always been considered an unorthodox if not outright controversial thinker. On the other hand, even many of his intellectual enemies consider him a distinguished and respectable scholar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.208.a;I appreciate it, but you can keep the book, Plethon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.208.b;Thank you, Plethon! I will make good use of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
