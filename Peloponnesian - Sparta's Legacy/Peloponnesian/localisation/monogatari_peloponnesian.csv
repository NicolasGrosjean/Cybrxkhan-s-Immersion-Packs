#monogatari.153.title;Rebirth of Sparta;;;;;;;;;;;x
#monogatari.153.desc;The Spartans are a people of legend. The great rival to Athens and the home of famous warriors like Leonidas, the Kingdom of Sparta was once powerful and mighty. But hubris became its undoing, and it was successfully conquered - first by its former Greek vassals and enemies, then by the Romans.\n\nWith the restoration of ancient Hellenic and Roman values across the Mediterranean, [From.GetTitledName] has re-established the Kingdom of Sparta, and wishes to continue its ancient legacy. Whether the Spartan warriors shall be feared once more has yet to be seen, however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#monogatari.153.a;Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.154.desc;Many inhabitants of the rugged regions of the Peloponnese are the descendants of the ancient Dorians, including the famed Spartans. Even to this day, they are renowned for their ferocity in battle, and prove useful to those who can win their loyalty. Today, we have an opportunity to recruit a renowned fighter from one of these tribes to fight for us.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.155.title;Peirene;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.155.desc;The waterworks of Corinth were famous in ancient times as a site of pagan pilgrimage, but they have fallen into ruin over the centuries. The fountain of Peirene, in particular, was the most important of these waterworks. It was supposedly the favored watering hole of the divine stallion Pegasus, and was sacred to the muses - poets would often visit the fountain to drink its blessed waters in the hope they would receive inspiration. After some initial hurdles, I have set aside some funds for the restoration of the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.155.a;Its holy waters flow, once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.156.desc;We are ready to levy some of the local Slavic tribesmen. Should we focus on levying the Melingoi or the Ezeritai? If we have the resources, we might want to levy both. The wealthier Melingoi are better armed and disciplined, while the rugged Ezeritai are better at guerrilla tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.160.desc;Every year, the Hellenes of Laconia hold the Hyacinthia festival. Dating back to antiquity, this festival was one of the Spartans' most important celebrations, lasting several days. This time, I've decided to officially attend the one of the celebrations myself, and made some financial contributions to the festival this year.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.160.a;And now we wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.161.desc;The first day of the Hyacinthia festival is here. I and my entourage have arrived at the festival grounds, ready to witness the entire week's worth of activities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.161.a;Let's begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.title;The First Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.desc;The first day is a day of mourning for Hyacinthus. The legends tell how Hyacinthus was the god Apollo’s lover. One day, the two had a friendly competition of throwing the discus, but when Hyacinthus threw his discus, it flew back and hit him, wounding him mortally. Apollo tried everything to save Hyacinthus, but one cannot stop a death dictated by the Fates.\n\nFrom Hyacinthus’ blood, Apollo created the Hyacinth flower, and he promised that he would forever remember his lost lover in song and music.\n\nOn this first day, sacrifices are offered to the dead, particularly Hyacinthus. Many openly weep for Hyacinthus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.a;I don’t cry at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.b;I cry a little, just to keep appearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.c;I cry an appropriate amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.162.d;I cry a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.title;Second Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.desc;The second day of Hyacinthia is upon us! It is livelier and more cheerful than the first day, and thus is more typical of an Apollonian festival. Today, devotees celebrate Hyacinthus’ rebirth as the hyacinth plant. In the spirit of celebrations, even foreigners, non-believers, and slaves are allowed to participate in the activities and great banquets of this day.\n\nMany exciting games and activities are held, to test local youths and let them demonstrate their abilities and knowledge as a rite of passage. Most prominent of the activities is a procession of beautifully adorned maidens, riding in highly ornate, decorated chariots made of wicker-work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.163.a;Sounds like a lot of fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.title;Third Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.desc;It is now the third day of the Hyacinthia. After the joyous celebrations of the second day, the atmosphere is now solemn once more, as many important rituals are conducted.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the festival’s focus as a rite of passage for young men and women, some of them are initiated into various mysteries dedicated to various deities or heroes. Most important of these mystery cults are those of Apollo’s, of course, but Dionysus’ is also quite prominent as well, particularly among the women.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.164.a;Let the day proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.title;The Hyacinthia Ends;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.desc;The Hyacinthia is over. The festival was a touching experience, a way for us to remember the hero Hyacinthus who died long ago, as well as an opportunity for the local youths to partake in many important rites of passage to ensure they will become productive members of society. Through these many celebrations and mournings, we remind ourselves of the things we value most in people such as bravery, respect, duty, and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.165.a;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.desc;The food during the first day of the Hyacinthia is very bland, as befits such a solemn day. Still, the bread tastes horribly plain, and the rest of the food offered is meager, and it is a far cry from the usual delicacies I eat at home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.a;How are the others managing it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.166.b;That’s no problem for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.desc;What sort of offering did I bring with me beforehand to offer to the dead during the Hyacinthia?;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.a;Just my presence is enough respect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.b;A small offering - a token present to put on the altar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.c;A medium offering - something decent but not too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.167.d;A large offering - a sacrifice worthy of the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.168.desc;During the rituals of the first day of the Hyacinthia, I must remain solemn and quiet as I mourn Hyacinthus’ death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.168.a;A tragic story, it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.desc;Local youths have assembled as part of the Hyacinthia, with lyres and flutes in their hands. These young boys and girls form various choruses, and sing and play music for the glory of Apollo. Some of the festival attendees even begin dancing to the music, moving around and swaying their bodies in the ancient Dorian way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.a;It is good music!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.169.b;I will join in on the dancing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.desc;On the second day of the Hyacinthia, people hold small sacrifices inside their homes, and many often invite others - stranger and friend alike - to come to their house to partake in these. I myself have been invited to join in on a sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.a;Very well! I’ll gladly join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.170.b;I have other things to attend to at the festivities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.174.a;Pathetic! And to think I thought you had a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.174.b;Man up! Loss is a part of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.174.c;You did very well, and should be proud of yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.174.d;It’s just a silly race, don’t worry about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.175.desc;Hurrah! My chosen contestant won the horse race. The youth looks quite pleased with himself.;;;;;;;;;;;x

monogatari.180.a;A kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.181.desc;The honey from [Root.GetName] is, like many kinds of honey from the Peloponnese, famous throughout much of Greece and Anatolia, and perhaps even beyond in places like Italy and Egypt.

monogatari.182.desc;Recently, a young man from a prominent local Maniot clan died, one you have had some contact with in the past. Yet when you came by to show your sympathies, you noticed his family and friends were not in mourning at all during the funeral. They seemed disappointed and strangely disrespectful if anything else. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.a;How insensitive of them! Do they not care for him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.b;An odd reaction, but it is of no concern to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.182.c;Perhaps there is a reason behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monogatari.183.desc;An elder, who must've seen your confused expression, explained: “When a man dies in such a manner we lament him as unslain, unbled, unjustified.
