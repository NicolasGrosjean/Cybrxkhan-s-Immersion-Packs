# PELOPONNESE: SPARTA'S LEGACY

On the coattails of the Harranian Immersion Pack, which focused on one group of vestigial Hellenic pagans, we travel now to the Peloponnesian peninsula, known among CKII players for being one of the last holdouts of Greco-Roman polytheism. In ancient times, it boasted fabled cities like Mycenae, Olympia, Corinth, and Sparta, but now, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the peninsula is in tatters. Slavic raiders and rugged Greeks squabble and fight, while foreign enemies look hungrily on this land that was once home to the feared Spartan warriors. 

In this Immersion Pack, usher yourself into the world of the medieval Peloponnese. Utilize the military strengths of the peoples inhabiting this land, be they the Tsakonian and Maniot pirates, or the Slavic barbarians who have made this land their home. Support the local economy and maintain the Hexamilion wall, or, if you're mad enough to try and restore Hellenic paganism, revive old Doric traditions like the Hyacinthia festival of Sparta. Will the Peloponnese become the powerful center of the Hellenic world like it once was, or shall it fade into obscurity?

## FEATURES

- Local Slavs, Tsakonians, and Maniots may arrive at your court as powerful, martial-focused characters.
- Decision to restore the Hexamilion wall if you own Corinth. It will add a special modifier to the province of Corinth.
- Two decisions for Hellenic pagans:
	- Restore the sacred Corinthian fountains of Peirene if you own the province of Corinth
	- Host the ancient Spartan festival of Hyacinthia if you own territory in the Peloponnese or are Tsakonian
- Take advantage of local industries, including Corinthian Silk, Kalamata Olives, and Tyrian Purple Dye, that are modifiers adding bonuses to Corinth, Methone, and Monemvasia respectively.
- Historical characters such as Danielis and Georgius Gemistus, aka Plethon, will appear randomly via event and have some special flavor associated with them.
	- Danielis appears sometime in the 9th century, and will grant your character a strong claim on the Byzantine/Roman Empire, along with a lot of gold, prestige, and piety. If you become Emperor, she will be granted a special nickname.
	- Plethon appears sometime in the 14th or 15th century. He is an openly Hellenic pagan scholar, who may eventually publish a book called the "Book of Laws." He will offer the artifact to you via an event, which you can accept, destroy, or let him keep it.
