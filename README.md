# CYBRXKHAN's IMMERSION PACKS

This is my collection of small, modular mini-mods that add some fun to various, often neglected cultures and regions. These Immersion Packs were loosely inspired by EUIV's, and generally include some flavor events and simple mechanics.

For those who don’t know me, I was the creator of CPR and VIET, part of the HIP collection of mods, though I no longer work on hat since my retirement a few years ago. Some of stuff here I’ve done for my own personal pleasure over the years after retirement. Consider them a spiritual successor to my VIET Immersion mod, on a smaller scale.

I won’t be making a lot of stuff like I used to; I don’t have time nor energy. Thus, THESE MODS ARE OFFERED AS IS AND I WILL NOT COMBINE THEM INTO ONE MOD. I am only sharing them now as a resource for modders and for those who want a bit of flavor in their games and/or are old VIETerans who miss the good old days. I’ll only go back or add stuff to these packs when I feel like it or if there are bugs.

Mods are compatible with everything unless otherwise indicated.

Please feel free to use my work in your mods, all I ask is that I am credited.
